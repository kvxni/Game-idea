Game Programming

My game idea is a side scrolling game. It is a survival game inwhich 
the player has to kill the incoming monsters.

The scenario will show a counter the points collected and his life.

The player is a knight and he has to kill the monsters.
The player can jump and slash the incoming monsters. The monsters 
will spawn randomly. If the player failed to kill the monster, he 
loses a life. The player can collect potions to restore his lives.

The game is endless unless the player loses all of his lives.

This game is inspired by mobile games.

I am looking for someone who cooperates and also enjoys what
their doing.
